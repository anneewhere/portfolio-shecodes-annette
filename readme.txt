Portfolio Assignment for Annette 

I am so sorry this is so late Jo! I understand and appreciate your hardwork for all the 
shecodes participants. I am very apologetic for submitting this really late!! 

I was having issues uploading this onto Github and had to delete my repository with all the commits I've done. Had an (awesome) friend help me submit it again :)

Thank you for teaching us and guiding us throughout the last few weeks!

Regards

Annette
